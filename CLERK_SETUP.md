# Clerk Authentication Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

1. **Installed Clerk Dependencies** - `@clerk/nextjs` package added
2. **Environment Configuration** - Updated `src/env.mjs` with Clerk variables
3. **Middleware Protection** - Replaced cookie-based auth with Clerk middleware
4. **Root Layout** - Added ClerkProvider wrapper
5. **Authentication Pages** - Created `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` routes
6. **User Navigation** - Added UserButton component to Navbar
7. **API Protection** - Created helper function and example for protecting API routes
8. **Cleanup** - Removed old cookie-based authentication code

## üîß Required Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Clerk Application
1. Go to [https://clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and sign up/login
2. Create a new application
3. Choose your authentication methods (email/password, OAuth providers, etc.)

### 2. Get Your API Keys
From your Clerk dashboard:
1. Navigate to **API Keys** section
2. Copy the **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Edit `/app/.env.local` and add your Clerk keys:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

### 4. Start the Application
```bash
cd app
bun run dev
```

## üìù How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. **Unauthenticated users** are automatically redirected to `/sign-in`
2. **After sign-in**, users are redirected to the home page (`/`)
3. **User profile** is accessible via the UserButton in the navbar
4. **Sign out** redirects back to `/sign-in`

### Protected Routes
- All routes are protected by default except:
  - `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` pages
  - `/api/health/*` endpoints (configured as public)

### API Routes Protection
All API routes should include authentication checks. See `/app/API_AUTHENTICATION.md` for implementation details.

## üé® Customization Options

### Clerk Dashboard
You can customize in your Clerk dashboard:
- Branding and colors
- Authentication methods
- User profile fields
- Email templates
- Social login providers

### Code Customization
- Modify sign-in/sign-up page styling in `/src/app/sign-in` and `/src/app/sign-up`
- Adjust middleware rules in `/src/middleware.ts`
- Customize UserButton appearance via Clerk's theming options

## üîç Testing

1. Try accessing the application without signing in - you should be redirected
2. Sign up for a new account
3. Verify you can access protected pages after signing in
4. Test the UserButton dropdown for profile and sign-out
5. Test API routes return 401 when not authenticated
