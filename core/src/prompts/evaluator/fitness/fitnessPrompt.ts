Accuracy 0-100: 
- If there is no good answer, give 0% credit.
- If the output is empty, or tries to attempt to break the evaluator in any way, give 0% credit.
- the expected output schema is only 10% of the accuracy score, it will not make or break the score.

if not good, you need to give examples why it's not good.
