/**
 * + the goal of this function is to provide a signal to:
 *   let the selection step in the evolutionary loop select the best workflows,
 *        but the best workflows are not always the ones with the highest scores.
 *        the best workflows are the workflows that work the best for all inputs.
 *        why then, do we rate per invocation?
 *        => because we can see how a workflow performs on the detailed level, per input.
 * + so in essence, this function its output is made specifically for
 *    the function that aggregates the fitnesses of each node invocation.
 *    what does that function need to know? it should know the structure already
 *      (this is a todo and currently not done),
 *      so it then does not need to get that.
