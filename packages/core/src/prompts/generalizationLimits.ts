GENERALIZATION LIMITS:
- The workflow goal defines how much to generalize. Respect the goal's specificity.
- Avoid introducing example-specific entities (brands, locations, domains) unless explicitly required by the goal.
- Prefer structural, behavioral, and process changes that remain valid across varied inputs within the goal's scope.
