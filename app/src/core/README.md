# Core Module - Autonomous Workflow System

Autonomous workflow system using evolutionary AI to optimize agent-based workflows. The system operates as graphs of AI agents that execute workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), pass structured messages, use tools through unified TypeScript/MCP interfaces, store large data in chunked shared memory, and evolve through cultural learning and genetic programming.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { Workflow } from "@/core/workflow/Workflow"
import { EvolutionEngine } from "@/core/improvement/gp/evolutionengine"
import { CONFIG } from "@/runtime/settings/constants"

// Create workflow with setup and expected format
const workflow = await Workflow.create(setup, expectedFormat, question)

// Cultural evolution mode (iterative improvement)
if (CONFIG.evolution.mode === "cultural") {
  const result = await workflow.run()
  // Cultural evolution through iterative analysis and improvement
}

// Genetic programming mode (population-based optimization)
if (CONFIG.evolution.mode === "genetic") {
  const engine = new EvolutionEngine({
    populationSize: 20, // 10-50 genomes
    generations: 10, // 10+ generations
    evaluator: customEvaluator,
  })

  const bestWorkflow = await engine.evolve()
}
