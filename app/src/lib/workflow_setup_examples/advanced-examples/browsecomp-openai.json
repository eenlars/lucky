Create fallback strategies that get progressively more aggressive\n\nKEY PRINCIPLE: There IS an answer. Your job is to systematically explore every possible path until found.\n\nFor each constraint type, you have specific strategies:\n- Educational background: CVs, theses, acknowledgments, alumni directories, recommendation letters\n- Dates: Wayback machine, news archives, press releases\n- Authorship: Conference proceedings, lab websites, grant acknowledgments\n\nNEVER conclude something cannot be found.
