## Who Our Customer Is

Not a developer. They're someone with a job to do. Customer emails piling up. Research papers to summarize. Content to create.

They don't want to learn about agents. They want their problem solved.

The system should help them 

1. know that our system can solve the task as soon as possible: no twirling around
2. interact with the software in the most natural and intuitive way possible.

Everything else is secondary.

## What Makes This Work

**1. Progressive disclosure**
- Show what matters first
- Hide complexity until needed
- First-time users aren't overwhelmed
- Power users can access everything

**2. Test-first mindset**
- Validation before configuration
- Real input → real output → real confidence
- If it works, user is done in 30 seconds
- If it doesn't, clear path to fix it

**3. Plain language throughout**
- "What this does" not "Configuration"
- "Test it now" not "Quick run"
- "Paste an email" not "Enter prompt"
- Speak to the user's job, not our implementation

**4. Adaptive interface**
- First visit: inspection + testing visible
- After testing: "Working as expected?" decision point appears
- If configuring: that section expands, others collapse
- If returning: Past Runs shows recent activity

**5. Testing Is Understanding**

Complex systems can't be understood through documentation. They must be experienced. The test interface comes first because interaction reveals truth that configuration screens cannot. You learn by doing, not by reading settings.

**6. Behavior Over Configuration**

Users want outcomes, not options. What an agent does matters infinitely more than how it's configured. Settings exist to serve behavior, never the reverse.

**7. Conversation Is Computing**

The command line is dead. Forms are dying. Conversation is the permanent interface between humans and intelligent machines. Every interaction should feel like natural dialogue.

## Core Design Principles

**Clarity Is Trust**

Every unnecessary element erodes confidence. Users need to know instantly what's important and what's not. Confusion is failure. Simplicity is competence made visible.

**Everything Is Direct**

No modes. No edit buttons. No save confirmations. Touch it, change it. The interface responds immediately to intention. Indirection is friction, and friction is death.

**Respect Through Restraint**

Show what's needed now. Hide what's needed later. Make discovery natural, not accidental. Cognitive load is sacred - never waste it.

**Speed Is Everything**

Waiting is breaking. 500ms feels like forever. 100ms feels like barely acceptable. Instant feels right. Performance isn't a feature - it's the foundation all features stand on.

**Color Is Information**

When everything screams for attention, nothing gets it. Monochrome is silence. Color is signal. Use it like you would use an exclamation point - rarely, and only when essential.

**The Interface Must Vanish**

The goal isn't to build a beautiful interface. The goal is to build no interface. Users should think about their work, not your design. The best interface is invisible.

**Continuous Dialogue**

Testing isn't a phase. It's an ongoing conversation. Every interaction teaches something. The system learns. The user learns. This dialogue never ends.

## The Permanent Truths

These aren't design trends. They're insights about how humans and machines best work together:

- Immediacy beats functionality. A fast system with three features beats a slow system with thirty.
- Clarity beats power. A clear system that does one thing beats a powerful system no one understands.
- Testing beats planning. A system you can try now beats a system you can configure forever.
- Direct beats indirect. Touching the thing itself beats clicking buttons about the thing.
- Less beats more. Always. Without exception.

These principles become more true as systems become more complex. Simplicity is the only thing that scales.
